# Federated Transfer Learning on Predictive Maintenance

In this study, the datasets have been downloaded from the links provided below:

Nasa turbofan get engine dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behrad3d/nasa-cmaps

Microsoft Azure Predictive Maintenance dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabbiswas1/microsoft-azure-predictive-maintenance

The files in this project are as below:

1. <u>preprocesing_NASA_turbofan.ipynb </u>

   This file is for preprocessing the NASA dataset into a multivariate time series dataset, where in each time frame the machine would fail or not.

2. preprocesing_Azure.ipynb

     This file is for preprocessing the Microsoft Azure predictive maintenance dataset. The purpose of this file is to transform the raw data into a multivariate time series dataset where each time frame for each machine of the models would fail or not.
